# ml-aided-video-processing
This repository contains learning materials for video processing with neural networks usage. 

## Project description
Here you will find a set of tutorials upon processing videos with machine learning methods. In the tutorials basic concepts currently available in ml aided video processing are discuss.

Tutorials are witten in Python and prepared in Jupyter Notebooks. Each Notebook contains one topic and can be run on local machine or with Google Colab, where GPU support is available. 

In this repository some additional materials are present for  better topic explanation purpose.
